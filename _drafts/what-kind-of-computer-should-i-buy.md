title: What kind of computer should I buy?
categories: beginner general
---

This has to be one of the most common questions asked of anyone who knows anything about computers, and nobody ever likes the answer.  

It depends.  

And while that is true, today there are a couple of easy answers for most general purpose computing situations and fewer execptions to the general purpose rule.  

## The Exceptions  
First you need to understand what general purpose computing is not. I will start by listing the most common specialized computing instances you are likely to run into.  

### Gamming  
If you are buying a computer to game on it should have specialized equipment. Later I will do a post to give an overviwe of what you should look for in a good gaming machine.  

### Audio and Video Editing  
If you need a computer to edit Audio or Video on, you will want something specialized to use for that. This will get a special post as well.

### CAD  
If you are working with AutoCAD or a similar tool it has pretty specific requirements and you will need a machine that meets those requirements. This is beyond my area of experties so I will remain netural on what to look for in a computer for this purpose.

### Graphics Design and Photo Editing
Typically this has pretty specific requirements but if you are an amature just moving into the professional market, there is an exception for this exception. I will cover this below. 

### Scientific computing 
If you are running probability simulations or chemical calculations, you need a very specialized machine. 
This kind of equipment is a bit beyond my area of expertise, so I will not offer any opnion on what you need here.  

### Software development. 
If you are a developer working on native apps, you may need some specialized equipment for that. 
If you are a web-developer, you can write most of your code on a pretty standard machine, this section will eventually get a specific post as well.

Outside of these use cases you are probably dealing with a very generic use case, and won't really need anything special. 

## General Purpose Computing  
There is an academic definition for General Purpost Computing, but for the purpose of this post we really only care about the practical definition.  

Surfing the web, accessing e-mail, light photo editing, document editing (word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, etc...), catching up on the news, watching videos and music, and school work.

If the definition above sounds like your use case for a computer. You are needing one for General Purpose use and won't really need to break the bank on highly specialized equipment.  

### What you need. 
For generic use ther are several options out there. The onl standby here is buying one of the sub $1k machines from your local retail shop, or online from places like Lenovo, HP, and Dell.  
In today's highly mobile always connected world, you'll probably want to have a laptop of some sort instead of a desktop. But in today's world there are even better options:  

#### Chromebook  
Google has a good idea here. A chromebook is a cheap way to meet the use case of 99% of the population. 
Students can use it to look up information for school. ChromeOS has access to Google Drive so working on documents is easy and you get a save option for opening with Microsoft Office tools later.  
So it's a good choice for most people and students. Prices vary and most people can get by with a cheaper one but you can spend $500+ to get a Chromebook that will last for a few years.  
If you have an Android phone already, it's a good choice because you can attach it to your existing account.  

#### iPads  
Apple has a really good tablet offering. For the basic use case you have access to the normal iPads and iPad minis. If you are a photographer or graphics designer the iPad Pro is really good as a mobile device you can work on image manipulation with.  
If you are looking for document editing, the iPad comes with Numbers (spreadsheet), Pages (word processor), and Keynote (presentation) pre-installed. If you want to surf the web, it handles that without problem. Basially, just like chromeOS you have a couple of options based on how much money you are willing to spend. And if you have an iPhone you will get great integration with the two.  
As for which one to buy, always shoot for the middle tier of offering. That is usually the best bang for your buck, you don't get the lowest specs and you don't spend as much as the top tier specs cost. 


### Bottom line  
Now the question, which one do I recommend. Up until a couple of years ago I always recommended Google. The Android and ChromeOS ecosystems are founded on Open Source ideas. But the Google tools are really built for tinkerers. I personally found myself fiddling around with settings, apps, layouts, launchers, etc... and it was awesone, you really just can't do that with iOS. And that's the point. When you want to sit down and work without having "things" to mess with, iOS is great. It's much more restrictive than Android, you do everything the Apple way.  
I used to think that it was a bad thing to be so restricted. But I've found that when people just want things to work, give them iOS. I myself have switched. I use an iPad Pro almost exclusivly for the general purpose things I do. I do some development work on it, I wrote this blog post on it. I can watch Netflix, Amazon Video and Youtube. I can read books, even kindle books, on it. I do some photo editing on it. I found that I rarely ever reach for my laptop anymore and I only use my desktop now if I'm wanting to game.  
Apple has been in the news a couple of times in the past couple of years because they have taken a strong stance for the privacy of their users. I think it is a good thing that with iOS more and more of the nice features are happening on device. Siri dosen't send your voice to Apple to process voice commands. The iOS device dosen't send your fingerprints to Apple to keep, they are stored on device. Photo processing for faces and things like that happen on device when it's on standby and plugged up. Your weak point is iCloud, and the weak part there is your password not Apple.  

So for the most part I say grab an iPad or iPad pro, if you need the extras that the Pro offers. If you are a student they are great and can be carried around easily, if you are just wanting an easy device to do most of the things you do, iOS is great.  
If you want something to fiddel with, go with a chromebook. They are pretty nice. The ones in the $500+ range are pretty powerful. And you can do what you want on them. Just be aware that everything you do on ChromeOS is potentially sent to Google for their systems to analyze.  
If you just really want a laptop. Lenovo and Dell make awesome business laptops if you are willing to spend $1k+ on them. Same goes for Apple with the MacBook Pro, even the lower-end MacBook isn't all that bad. But be aware that even the low-end MacBook starts at over $1k.  

Hope this helps the next time you need to by a computer.
